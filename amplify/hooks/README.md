# Custom Amplify CLI Hooks

This directory contains custom hook scripts that can be used to customize the behavior of the Amplify CLI.

## Pre-Push Hook

The pre-push hook runs before the backend resources are pushed to the cloud. This can be used to:

- Validate resource configurations
- Transform data models
- Generate additional resources

## Post-Push Hook

The post-push hook runs after the backend resources are pushed to the cloud. This can be used to:

- Configure additional service integrations
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Deploy additional resources

## Usage

1. Create your hook scripts in this directory
2. Make them executable: `chmod +x hook-name.sh`
3. The Amplify CLI will automatically run them at the appropriate time

## Example Hooks

### Pre-Push Data Validation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-push-hook.sh

echo "Validating data models..."
# Add your validation logic here
```

### Post-Push Configuration
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# post-push-hook.sh

echo "Configuring additional services..."
# Add your configuration logic here
```
