# How to Push Changes to AWS Amplify

To push your changes to AWS Amplify, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure AWS Amplify CLI is installed**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Amplify**
   If not already configured:
   ```bash
   amplify configure
   ```

3. **Push your changes**
   ```bash
   amplify push
   ```
   This will deploy your backend changes to AWS cloud.

4. **For frontend changes**
   Your frontend changes will be automatically deployed when you push to your connected Git repository. The deployment process is handled by AWS Amplify's continuous deployment pipeline.

5. **Verify deployment**
   - Check your Amplify Console in AWS to monitor the deployment status
   - Access your app's URL to verify the changes are live

6. **Troubleshooting**
   - If you encounter any issues, check the build logs in the Amplify Console
   - Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured
   - Verify that your amplify.yml configuration is correct
